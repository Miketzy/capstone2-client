          <h2>OUR BEGININGS</h2>
          <p>
            Our journey began as a small initiative, formed by a team of
            dedicated researchers and developers who saw the need to make
            biodiversity information accessible to everyone. Working closely
            with the RIC, we collected and validated data on local species, with
            the vision of creating a comprehensive and interactive platform.
            Over time, this project evolved from a simple concept into a fully
            developed system that not only serves as a valuable resource but
            also engages users in learning about and protecting our environment.
